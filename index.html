  <h4>AKA Quantum Zombies</h4>
  <p class="punchline">A game of bricks and the dead. <br> As family friendly as any zombie franchise!</p>

<article>
<hr>
<p>Hi! This is a co-op zombie extension to <a href="http://brikwars.com">BrikWars</a> with rules built to mimic the tropes from pop culture.</p>
<p>Brikwars Zombie is a co-op game with no player playing the zombies and just a tiny bit of maintenance to do around them.
Mechanic is built on top of Quick Wars mechanics for simplicity, but can easily be adapted for full Brik Wars mechanics too.</p>

</code></pre><h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
<h2 id="existence">Existence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As you might have noticed in the movies - zombies tend to exist in places only while the main characters are in the area. This led to a conclusion that they exist everywhere with certain probabilities and only by looking at a place you collapse the quantum function of the superposition of zombie existence and non-existence to determine what the observable zombie presence is.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="to-be">To be</h3>
<p>Every time a new location becomes visible:</p>
<ul>
<li>small space, room, corner, closet - roll <code>D6</code>. If <code>D6 &lt;= DANGER_LVL</code> spawns a zombie there</li>
<li>large space, open area - roll <code>D6</code>. If <code>(D6-1) * DANGER_LVL</code> zombies spawn (includes critical rolls - roll a 6, you roll again and add!)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Example

DANGER_LVL is 3

- I enter a room, roll 2 - a zombie is there.
- I enter another room, roll 3 - a zombie is there.
- I enter yet another room, roll 4 - it&#39;s empty.
- I go out to the open, roll 3 - 6 zombies are there.
- I run to the other side of the building, roll 1 - there are no zombies there.
</code></pre><h3 id="not-to-be">Not to be</h3>
<p>Zombies get removed after sight of them is lost and cannot be regained in 2 turns of a player going in their direction. Just like in the movies!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="some-certainty-in-this-world">Some certainty in this World</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Most movies and comic books on zombies have locations relevant for the plot, where pre-defined zombies reside. These in turn seem to be immune to entropy and seem entangled with other plot elements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Special locations, containing quest items, supply or being important to the plot need to have their crew of zombie pre-defined. All other rules apply, so apart from the main zombie characters, you’ll get all the additional ones from dice rolls.</p>
<h2 id="interactions">Interactions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Zombies in movies don&#39;t plan, don&#39;t plot. They&#39;re just the walking dead, remember? Walking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zombie characters only have the movement phase after all players moved. Their attacks are triggered during the player turn.</p>
<h3 id="zombie-walk">Zombie walk</h3>
<p>Zombies can stay still, wander randomly or walk towards something that grabbed their attention.</p>
<p>To make remembering their state easier, you should mark it with their hands.</p>
<ul>
<li>A standing zombie has both hands down.</li>
<li>A wandering zombie has one hand in front of it</li>
<li>A zombie walking towards something has both hands in front of it</li>
</ul>
<p><em>credit for this idea goes to Dr. StrangeBrik from brikwars forum</em></p>
<p>Zombies move <code>2”</code> a turn (random direction if wandering)</p>
<p>When a zombie gets spawned roll a die. If <code>D6 &lt;= DANGER_LVL</code> the zombie will be wandering</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="horde-rule">Horde rule</h4>
<p>When zombies are closer than <code>2”</code> from each other, they are considered a horde, which will move the same direction (so you only roll for direction once for the whole horde)
If a horde meets a character, all zombies get focused.</p>
<h3 id="zombie-attention">Zombie attention</h3>
<p>If a minifig is running (no stealth) within <code>5”</code> of a zombie (or a horde) it focuses the attention of zombie.</p>
<p>Noises also focus zombie attention, but they get attracted individually, based on range. (horde rule off)
So a gunshot or a rumble from a car crash or a wall breaking down will attract zombie in <code>10”</code> range <em>unless 6 is rolled on a <code>D6</code> die</em>. All zombies within range get focused and start going towards the source of the sound. They switch back to random wandering if they reach the target and find nothing there. This can be used to distract them, obviously.</p>
<h4 id="stealth">Stealth</h4>
<p>A minifig can be stealthy, but to do that it can only move <code>2”</code> per turn. So no outrunning zombies without grabbing more attention!</p>
<h3 id="close-encounters">Close encounters</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You can run through a bunch of zombie avoiding them and pushing away as confirmed in an experiment by Mythbusters. The factor that decides if you’ll live is density of the horde. And luck.</p>
<p>Also, if it&#39;s not the season 1 you don&#39;t have to worry much about scratches</p>

<p>In a player&#39;s turn, zombies can be attacked as per QuickWars rules.</p>
<p>When a player’s minifig moves in a way that puts it within <code>1”</code> of a zombie at any point of the route, a zombie roll happens for each zombie within range while the character is moving.</p>

<p>When using Zombie Dice, roll a die and put it away. You need to decide if you want to use the riskier ones first or later. When you run out, start over with the full set.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="danger-level">Danger Level</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As the plot approaches a conclusion (or a mid-season finale) the world gets more and more intense. In zombie infected universe a factor exist that dictates how many zombies should turn out to be waiting around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>DANGER_LVL</code> is a value between 1 and 6</p>
<p>You can start with any <code>DANGER_LVL</code> you want - it will affect the difficulty of the game.</p>
<p>Every game should have critical scenes in its plot, which permanently increase the <code>DANGER_LVL</code> by 1 as they begin.
Need examples? See <a href="">scenarios</a>.</p>
<p><code>DANGER_LVL</code> is increased temporarily:</p>
<ul>
<li>for 2 turns after a minifig dies</li>
<li>while a character is alone (nobody else in the room or open area)</li>
<li>in a location that has a warning/danger sign at the entrance</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="characters">Characters</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to split up!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Characters work just like minifigs in BrikWars with one exception - a successful zombie attack means the minifig is wounded. The next attack will kill them. Mark a wounded minifig by attaching a 1 stud red piece to it.</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>Regular actions work like in BrikWars. Pick up, give, throw, close door, operating levers or consoles etc.
The same with building constructions.</p>
<p>Special actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repair - based on number of studs (see damage to structures in QuikWars). Agreed number of various tools repairs a specific plot-critical structure; bonuses from being a Mechanic
example: a broken truck engine requires the team to collect 5 unique tools that would help (only grey/dark grey and black tool accessories helps + use a bit of common sense and don’t repair vehicles with binoculars)</li>
<li>Explore - looking for useful items / opening a closed compartment / container, hacking or breaking into something (ATM, safe, lockpicking)</li>
<li>Firefighting - one typical brick-built fire extinguisher (two bricks: ‘can’ + ‘tap’) allows to take 2 flame bricks, one per action/turn. Firefighters have an extra action in turn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character creation</h2>
<p>Players can choose any character, but make sure they have one advantage and one disadvantage. Regular characters should start with only hand weapons.</p>
<p>Alternatively players can pick 2 characters - a mix of a strong and a weak one, choosing their traits accordingly (example: a cop and a scared teenager).</p>
<hr>
<p>Example disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traumatized: freaking out at random or when losing HP - can move at most 2&quot; in a turn when freaked out.</li>
<li>Fearful: when entering a place and discovering a zombie <code>D6=1</code> makes noise, <code>D6=2</code> runs away.</li>
<li>Terrible with guns: You cannot use a ranged weapon throughout the game. You can carry one to pass it on to your teammate.</li>
<li>Typical Kid: Terrible With Guns (see above) + you can’t drive a car or motorbike (skateboard and a regular bike are allowed);</li>
<li>Diarrhea: you have to explore 3 different rooms that count as bathrooms as your only actions in your turns; you can still collect items this way.</li>
<li>Collector of unattended possessions: you have to collect (pick up and carry to the place your team stores the resources) two bricks that are useless for the quest but can be interpreted as art, jewellery and other precious items; conflicts with cops on your team are always a good storytelling device here.</li>
<li>Alcoholic: you have to collect 4 extra food&amp;drinks items, above the quest requirement; you can mark alcohol as additional resource if you like. You have to use the first and the third resource after getting it to the safehouse. Your movement is reduced by 2&quot; when driving or riding bikes.</li>
<li>Zombary’s baby: your character has a child or a younger sibling. You have to explore a particular room on the map to find it and check if it got infected. Roll for zombie present in the room - if you roll a zombie, the kid is turned. Be sad. If no, you have to take the baby to the safe place as if you would take a piece of resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cop: starts with a ranged weapon. +1 dice increased basic attack</li>
<li>Badass: If first attack on a zombie didn&#39;t kill it, gets another try</li>
<li>Sneaky: twice a game when a zombie is granted an attack against you, you can move your minifig away from it in any direction, up to 2&quot;; the attack doesn’t happen.</li>
<li>Mechanic: gets a free repair-only action per turn</li>
<li>Firefighter: gets a free &quot;put out fire&quot;-only action per turn</li>
<li>Doctor - You start with as many tokens (syringes, pills) as the starting number of characters. You can approach a wounded minifig and remove one token to restore that minifigs health. Including yourself</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Example funny characters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Footballer: You start with a football.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dribble: You don’t carry the ball in your hands if you want but it is still in your possession when you move.</li>
<li>Shoot: Once in your turn you can use the football as a ranged weapon to knock down one zombie. Place the football symmetrically (at the same angle and distance) from the undead you knocked down this way. The zombie can still attack people passing by but cannot move. The abilities can be used with any football on the map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Skateboarder: You start with a skateboard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skating: you use the skateboard as your vehicle, moving 1,5x the normal distance per turn. You can do skateboarding tricks on structures that are at the level of minifig’s legs/torso connection or below<ul>
<li>Ollie: Once per movement, you can jump over things or jump to connect grinds.</li>
<li>Grind: When there is a &quot;grindable&quot; surface such as a rail/ledge/low wall etc. you can grind it, adding its whole length to your normal movement as a bonus. The surface mustn’t be occupied by minifigs or have other bricks attached on top of it (but can have studs). Another obstacle for grinding is a zombie that stands too close to the surface - you might try to knock it down as a melee attack (once per movement) but you fall down and end your movement if you don’t succeed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Jedi: You start with a lightsaber. Once per game you can convince a zombie or a horde that these are not the brains they are looking for: they return to the Standing state (hands down) and become disinterested.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h1>
<h2 id="escape-this-goddamn-city">Escape this goddamn city</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This place is swarming with zombies. Let&#39;s get out of here now! OR as soon as we collect guns and food and fuel and...</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Collect food bricks - 2 per minifig</li>
<li>Collect 7 fuel bricks for the trip ahead</li>
<li>Collect 3 tools to fix your escape car</li>
</ul>
<p>6 fuel can be found in a gas station, but it&#39;s burning with 4 fires so fire extinguishers have to be found first.
Fuel in quantities of 1 or 2 can be found in random locations.</p>
<p>1 fuel has to be used to start a motorbike or other small vehicle for the length of the game.</p>
<h2 id="the-abandoned-mansion">The abandoned mansion</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that rich guy&#39;s house outside our town? Maybe the place is empty now? After all, the owner isn&#39;t a psycho killer, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enter the house</li>
<li>Explore the Garage / Sadist Studio</li>
<li>Find the hostage and take them to the escape car</li>
</ul>
<p>After all that...</p>
<ul>
<li>Psycho killer appears: you fight both zombies (if any) and him. The Psycho Killer has the same stats as characters and always attacks the nearest character; never retreats, fights to their psycho death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Variant: if only one person arranges the build and controls zombies, the recommended plot twist is that the rescued hostage is the true psycho killer the characters should fear. This plot twist should be revealed when the hostage is escorted to safety or even possibly armed by the characters.
Variant: (additional objective) Collect 2 tools from the Garage</p>
<h2 id="jailbreak">Jailbreak</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Man, these smartphones are crap. Also, a friend texted me that the guards in his juvie forgot to let him out before running from zombies themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Locate the juvie HQ for a Key Card OR take 2x explosives from the Armory</li>
<li>Rescue the Prisoner</li>
<li>The Prisoner is injured: get medical supplies from the Healthcare Facility</li>
</ul>
<p>The scenario build should have a lot of narrow passages and small rooms, with around 2-3 entrances/exits. Rescuing the prisoner, especially using the explosives, should affect the routes (block some corridors permanently).
Plot twist: The injured Prisoner turns into a zombie. Well, at least you tried to help him out.</p>
<p>Hint for placing things at random: Choose a few key places on the map. Those spots will give the characters a chance to get what they need. Now take the same number of containers of one type and put the chosen items inside. You can ask someone who&#39;s not playing to put the containers on the map or do it yourself. To win the fair play trophy, fill the containers contents with the same bricks but of various colours so that you don&#39;t feel the difference in weight.</p>
<p>For instance: in the first scenario, there should be some extra fuel spread on the map. You choose 3 spots, some backyards around town. Now you choose the amount of extra fuel, say, 0/2/3. You put the resource markers in the containers Shuffle the containers and place them in the previously chosen spots.</p>
<p>Treasure chests and barrels make great containers. We used chests/crates from Adventurers series, covered with Collectible Minifigures stands and large barrels covered with radar dish pieces. As long as you can&#39;t tell the difference between the containters of one type, they&#39;re good.</p>
